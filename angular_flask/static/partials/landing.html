  <h2>Visualize and Contextualize Year-long Fitbit Data</h2>
  <br>
  <h4 class="text-muted">The purpose of this page is to allow users to analyze, contextualize, and make goals based on their year-long activity data. </h4>
  <h4 class="text-muted">Specifically, we do the following: chart both daily and monthly (summarized) activity data, identify trends in activity for user-submitted date ranges, and calculate recent activity trends in comparison to a year ago -- which is used as a target metric.</h4>
  <h4 class="text-muted">As a placeholder for a user-uploaded folder of retrieved Fitbit activity data (due to Fitbit's API limits), we are using jhh283's data for this application.</h4>
